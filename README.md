# Kaggle-House-Price-Prediction
 
This is my first Kaggle competition, I try to walk through the process of understanding data, cleaning data based on exploring the characteristics of columns with missing data, and training data with different models. I'm a beginner in the amazing field of data, I know it's not perfect submission, but I'm trying to apply some knowledge I've learned. I think the best way to improve is to practice more, and I would appreciate any advice and suggestions, thank you!
